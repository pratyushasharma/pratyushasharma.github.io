I am a first year EECS PhD student at MIT advised by Prof. [Antonio Torralba](http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/). My research goal is to understand what can be learnt from rich multimodal interactions (vision, touch and sounds) with objects (and people) in the world around us. I am also interested in  developing  systems that enable robots to efficiently abstract knowledge across tasks, reason, understand goals and reliably interact in the real world. 

At MIT, I am supported by the Great Educators Fellowship.

Prior to this I was at Carnegie Mellon University for a year long research internship advised by Prof. [Abhinav Gupta](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abhinavg/). Even before that I was an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. 

A consolidated list of my research publications is on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RGiCLUgAAAAJ&hl=fr). 

Besides research, I enjoy photography, dancing and cooking (also, eating).
